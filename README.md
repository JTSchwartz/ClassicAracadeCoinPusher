# Classic Arcade Coin Pusher
## By: Jacob Schwartz

As the title suggests, this is a simple modern take on the good old fashioned arcade game of dropping a coin into a pile of bunch more in hopes that its enough to get one of the push arms to shove even more coins over the edge.

## Instructions
1. Move the gold slider at the bottom to where about you want the coin to fall in at the back of the platform
1. Hit the Spacebar to drop a coin once you have chosen your placement
1. Watch the push arms go to work and see if you force any coins to fall over the edge
